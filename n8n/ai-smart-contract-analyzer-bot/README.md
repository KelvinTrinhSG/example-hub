# ai-smart-contract-analyzer-bot

A Telegram bot that uses AI to analyze and summarize BNB Chain smart contracts.

ðŸ§  Features
ðŸŸ¢ Users send a smart contract address to Telegram.
ðŸ¤– AI checks if the address is valid and known (e.g., USDT, USDC...).
ðŸ§  If valid, it uses BscScan to fetch the ABI and analyze it using OpenAI.
ðŸ“„ The contract is explained in simple terms, including warnings if it's potentially dangerous.
ðŸ’¬ Supports structured output and memory for context-aware interaction.
ðŸ›‘ Ignores /start command and does nothing.
